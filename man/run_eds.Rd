\usage{
run_eds(lon, lat, unit, time, buffer = 0.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{lon}{Numeric vector of longitudes for the data points.}

\item{lat}{Numeric vector of latitudes for the data points.}

\item{unit}{Character vector specifying the unit (e.g., island name) for each point.}

\item{time}{Vector of dates corresponding to each data point.}

\item{buffer}{Numeric value specifying the buffer distance for spatial operations. Default is 0.25.}
}
\value{
The function writes merged netCDF files and saves extracted climatological
and time-series data to specified directories. It returns \code{NULL} invisibly.
}
\description{
Downloads and processes environmental netCDF files based on provided parameters.
This function merges multiple netCDF files into a single file and extracts relevant
climatological and time-series data for specified geographic points.
}
\details{
The \code{run_eds} function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
